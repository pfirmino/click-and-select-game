# click-and-select-game
A simple click and select system within a 3D world map for games, developed using Java and JME plataform.

<h2>Objective</h2>
Implementing the Nifty GUI system to change between the main framework screens, in this case: Splash Screen, Loading Screen, Main Screen (Menu) and World Map Screen.
After that, a simple select and gesture system was implemented comprising 3 functionalities:
* Select any character in the 3D world map
* Deselect all of them by tapping twice anywhere on the floor
* Identify 2 fingers on the screen and if it's true, only if it's true, move the camera in the world.

<h2>Where is the main source code?</h2>
You can find the files under the following package `com.aerolitos.prj44`, in the `./src` path.

<h2>Testing</h2>
The apk was compiled and tested in Galaxy S7, and everything worked as expected. Bellow You'll find the screenshots of the application.
